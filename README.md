# 🚢 cod2-docker

Docker image for your Call of Duty 2 server. Libcod included!

All the tags can be found [here](https://github.com/users/rutkowski-tomasz/packages/container/package/cod2-server-1.3).

# 🚀 Features

This repo was created beacuse it seems that [cod2docker](https://github.com/Lonsofore/cod2docker) is not longer maintained. Also it includes following advancements:

- integrating with latest [zk_libcod](https://github.com/ibuddieat/zk_libcod)
- speex integration for dynamic sound loading
- github workflow builds and publishes images on push
- running container as non-root user
- making mounted main and library folders read-only
- update to latest ubuntu & packages version
- other minor optimizations: removing not used packages

# 🤷🏻‍♂️ How to use?
